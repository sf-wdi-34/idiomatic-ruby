# Idiomatic Ruby

## Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

**The Ruby Programming Language** is written to be as close to the natural English language as possible.  To properly code in Ruby we should abandon our previous structures and explore the 'ease' of Ruby Idioms.

## What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Discuss the proper usage of Ruby methods and syntax
- Compare and contrast the difference between a `Javascript` way and `Ruby` way of approaching a problem
- Create methods that demonstrate best practices and efficient code.

## Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Synthesize basic `Ruby` statements 
- Understand the various data types in `Ruby`
- Navigate and execute live code in `irb`, `pry`, or a `.rb` file.


##Overview
Idiomatic is the concept of using, containing, or denoting expressions that are natural to a native speaker. Idiomatic programming means that your program contains statements that are unique to the language; i.e., you actually use the expressive power (or lack thereof – PHP) of the language in your programs.

Ruby takes advantage of having language-specific expressions and methods. The more comfortable you are with built-in features, the more succinct and self-documenting your codebase will become.


###Ruby Idioms

* use return statements only if needed for readability - take advantage of implicit returns!
* use `something.nil?` to check if something is `nil`
* use `something.zero?` to check if something is `0` (zero is truthy)
* negative indices: `cats[-1]`
* ranges: `(0..10)` for inclusive or `(4...12)` for right-exclusive
* use `.first` or `.last` if dealing with first or last item
* other named methods: `cats.empty?`, `cats.any?`


##TODO:
Navigate to this [Google Document](https://goo.gl/SHzrGD) and create Ruby methods for each problem.  You will be coding as a table group.  Once your method achieves the provided input/output goals, submit your group's code in the appropriate space.  Try to keep it short and sweet!


## What did we cover?
<!-- call  out the skills that we have learned -->
- Use implicit return thoughtfully.
- Check if a helper method exists before creating one.
- Ruby has many built-in methods available to us.  
- **Don't sacrifice readability for shorter, cute or clever solutions.**
